# This is just the list of all 'pip' requirements
# Most of this is dependencies of other libraries, but
# it doesn't matter. You can write this file by yourself
# to have more control around requirements.
#
# [Hint]:
#     You no need to write exact version of library.
#     You can write just the name of library or
#     the comparable version with other version or
#     the version older/newer then some version.
#     (check the official documentation).
#
# But...
# If you are lazy (like me) you can just type
# in command line "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
# and have a nice day!
